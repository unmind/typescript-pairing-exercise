# Description

A simple TypeScript mood check in application, built in React and Express

# Instructions

Before your interview please clone this repo and check you can get the application running, following the steps below. Feel free to take a bit of a look around the codebase too - though we recommend spending no more than 30 - 60 minutes in total

# Prerequisites

You'll need to have [installed Nodejs and the Node Package Manager (NPM)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/development_environment#installing_node) in order to run the Express server

# Installing and running the app

To run the client:

```
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

And the server:

```
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

# Running tests

Both the client and server use jest for tests. These can be run by within each directory by running `npm test`
